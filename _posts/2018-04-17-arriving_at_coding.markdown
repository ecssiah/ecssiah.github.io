I didn't decide to start coding. I was told it was a requirement. I began working towards a degree in physics after returning from music college in Boston. Given the incredible utility of being able to model complex physical systems, learning to code is now a requirement of learning to do physics. I was enrolled in a series of courses focused around object-oriented programming using the Java language. I very quickly discovered a true enjoyment for programming. In fact, I started spending an inordinate amount of my time whittling away on the assigned coding projects, sometimes to the detriment of my physics work. I found it so satisfying to make an application work just a little bit better -- to make the code a little bit cleaner, or a little bit more efficient.

After I left school, I continuously found myself drawn back towards working with different programming languages and especially doing graphical work. Eventually, I decided this was undoubtadely something I could do for a living.
